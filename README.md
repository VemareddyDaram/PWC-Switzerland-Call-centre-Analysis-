The column names are : Call Id, Agent, Date, Time, Topic, Answered (Y/N), Resolved, Speed of answer in seconds, AvgTalkDuration and Satisfaction rating.                                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
 # Data Modeling                                                                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
 Since there is one table. So, there is no need of Data Modelling.

 # Data Preparation                                                                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
 After note down the important KPIs, I imported the Excel file into Power BI Desktop, and before loading the dataset, I went to Power Query to perform some transformations.                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
 Note : All the transformation I have done based on the KPIs I need, It means I will only transform my business column.                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
 1. The Avgtalkduration Column contains date and Time Value                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
 I didn’t need the date value, so I extracted the time from the column using the Transform tab, selecting the ‘Time Only’ option. This allowed me to successfully extract the time from it.                          
                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
  2. I replaced null values with 0 in the satisfaction rating attribute. Since there were no specific instructions on how to handle null values, and considering that it is a numeric field crucial for further business analysis, replacing them with 0 was chosen for ease of calculating DAX measures.                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
  3. After that next step is to add a custom column named ‘Call Duration,’ where I converted the values of AvgTalkDuration from hours and minutes into seconds. This transformation facilitates the calculation of the total call duration in seconds.      ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/252207fa-3797-426e-b627-00b14f9c9acb)

                            Call duration column                                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
4. After calculating the call duration column, I noticed the presence of null values in the column. Consequently, I replaced these null values with 0. Earlier, I encountered difficulty in replacing null values with 0 in the ‘Avgtalkduration’ column since it only accepts time values. I am addressing this now.

                               Replaced Null value with 0                                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
 5. Next step is to insert new column “Start of hour” to round down a time column to the beginning of the hour.

                                  Start of hour Column                                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
 # DAX Calculated Measures                                                                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
 After doing all the transformation in the power query, its time to create some DAX measure.                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
 1. Call Volume : Here I am extracting the ‘Call ID’ column from the fact table, and subsequently, calculating the total count of rows that have non-null and non-blank values in this column.

9. Call Abandoned : Extracting the Answered(Y/N) Column from the fact table specifically selection rows which is equals to “N” and subsequently, we apply the COUNT function to determine the total number of rows meeting this condition. The result of this count is then assigned to a new measure named ‘Call Abandoned’.

 I have created some calculated column which i am going to use in my visual.                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
1. Dayname : I have created this column to extract the full name of the day of the week from the date values present in the fact table. The ‘Format’ function is utilized to modify the format of a given value. In this specific case, the date value serves as the first argument, and the second argument specifies the desired format, which, in this instance, is set to retrieve the full name of the day of the week.

 2. DayNo : I have created this column to extract the day of the week from the date column present in the fact table. The ‘WeekDay’ function is applied to each date values in the date column, which returns an integer representing the day of the week, this is the first argument. Second argument is the numbering system for the days of the week. It can take values from 1 to 3. The default is 1, where Sunday is considered the first day of the week. If you use 2, Monday is the first day of the week, and so on. If you use 3, Monday is the first day of the week, and Sunday is the last.

You might be wondering why I created the ‘Dayno’ column. Well, its purpose is to facilitate the sorting of my ‘Day Name’ column. In my visuals, I aim to present Sunday as the first day of the week, followed by Monday as the second day, and so forth.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
 Okay Now i have created all the necessary DAX measures. It’s time to create some visuals.
