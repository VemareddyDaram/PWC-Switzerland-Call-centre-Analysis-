Ever wondered what goes on behind the scenes when you dial a customer service hotline? Unraveling the mysteries of call center trends not only reveals the challenges these hubs face but also opens the door to strategic solutions.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Let’s unravel the mysteries together with the help of some Visuals, Charts and tables.                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Pwc Call Centre Analysis is the Power BI report which I have designed to track the relevant KPIs for the Pwc. This is the first task provided by the Pwc in the Virtual Internship on Forage Platform.

 The Dataset is provided by the Pwc in the excel format. Dataset Consists of 10 Columns with 5000 rows. The column names are : Call Id, Agent, Date, Time, Topic, Answered (Y/N), Resolved, Speed of answer in seconds, AvgTalkDuration and Satisfaction rating.                                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
 # Data Modeling                                                                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
 Since there is one table. So, there is no need of Data Modelling.

Speed of Answer : How much time the agent took to answer the call.                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
 # Data Preparation                                                                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
 After note down the important KPIs, I imported the Excel file into Power BI Desktop, and before loading the dataset, I went to Power Query to perform some transformations.                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
 Note : All the transformation I have done based on the KPIs I need, It means I will only transform my business column.                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
 1. The Avgtalkduration Column contains date and Time Value                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
 I didn’t need the date value, so I extracted the time from the column using the Transform tab, selecting the ‘Time Only’ option. This allowed me to successfully extract the time from it.                          
                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
  2. I replaced null values with 0 in the satisfaction rating attribute. Since there were no specific instructions on how to handle null values, and considering that it is a numeric field crucial for further business analysis, replacing them with 0 was chosen for ease of calculating DAX measures.                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
  3. After that next step is to add a custom column named ‘Call Duration,’ where I converted the values of AvgTalkDuration from hours and minutes into seconds. This transformation facilitates the calculation of the total call duration in seconds.      ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/252207fa-3797-426e-b627-00b14f9c9acb)

                            Call duration column
