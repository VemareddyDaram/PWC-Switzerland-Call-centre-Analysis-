 Since there is one table. So, there is no need of Data Modelling.

 # Data Preparation                                                                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
 After note down the important KPIs, I imported the Excel file into Power BI Desktop, and before loading the dataset, I went to Power Query to perform some transformations.                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
 Note : All the transformation I have done based on the KPIs I need, It means I will only transform my business column.                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
 1. The Avgtalkduration Column contains date and Time Value

                                  Avg Talk Duration Before Transformation                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                   
 I didn’t need the date value, so I extracted the time from the column using the Transform tab, selecting the ‘Time Only’ option. This allowed me to successfully extract the time from it.

  2. I replaced null values with 0 in the satisfaction rating attribute. Since there were no specific instructions on how to handle null values, and considering that it is a numeric field crucial for further business analysis, replacing them with 0 was chosen for ease of calculating DAX measures.

                                     Satisfaction Rating Column with null values

                                    Replace null with 0                                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                           
  3. After that next step is to add a custom column named ‘Call Duration,’ where I converted the values of AvgTalkDuration from hours and minutes into seconds. This transformation facilitates the calculation of the total call duration in seconds.

                            Call duration column                                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
4. After calculating the call duration column, I noticed the presence of null values in the column. Consequently, I replaced these null values with 0. Earlier, I encountered difficulty in replacing null values with 0 in the ‘Avgtalkduration’ column since it only accepts time values. I am addressing this now.

                               Replaced Null value with 0                                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
 5. Next step is to insert new column “Start of hour” to round down a time column to the beginning of the hour.

 I have created some calculated column which i am going to use in my visual.                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
1. Dayname : I have created this column to extract the full name of the day of the week from the date values present in the fact table. The ‘Format’ function is utilized to modify the format of a given value. In this specific case, the date value serves as the first argument, and the second argument specifies the desired format, which, in this instance, is set to retrieve the full name of the day of the week.

 2. DayNo : I have created this column to extract the day of the week from the date column present in the fact table. The ‘WeekDay’ function is applied to each date values in the date column, which returns an integer representing the day of the week, this is the first argument. Second argument is the numbering system for the days of the week. It can take values from 1 to 3. The default is 1, where Sunday is considered the first day of the week. If you use 2, Monday is the first day of the week, and so on. If you use 3, Monday is the first day of the week, and Sunday is the last.

You might be wondering why I created the ‘Dayno’ column. Well, its purpose is to facilitate the sorting of my ‘Day Name’ column. In my visuals, I aim to present Sunday as the first day of the week, followed by Monday as the second day, and so forth.”

 ## Overview page :                                                                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
 First and foremost, I have placed all the KPIs at the top my page so that the Client can see most import KPIs first and can keep track of them.

 and to navigate from one page to another. I have provided buttons : Home button for overview page , Agent button for Agent Analytics page and i button for Insights page and Clear button for clear all the filters applied in the given page.

 ### Table Visual:                                                                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
 Table visual is a visualization tool used to represent data in a tabular format, similar to a spreadsheet. The primary purpose of using a table visual, is to present detailed, structured data in rows and columns for easy reference and analysis.                                                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
 I have used the table visual to show the performance of the call agents distinguish between various metrics like Call Volume, CSAT%, Call duration, Speed of answer(in sec), Call Abandoned%, Call Resolved%. So that, we can track the performance of each agent working in the Call Centre and make data driven decision.

### Matrix Visual:                                                                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
 To display the busiest day by time, I have used the matrix visual and converted it into a heat map. For this, I have employed a gradient color combination to illustrate peak and off-peak times. From this visual, we can get an idea of which day and what time are the busiest.

 ### Donut Chart :                                                                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
 Donut Chart is circular statistical graphic that display data in a way that represents the proportion of a whole.                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
 I have used a Donut Chart to display how many Calls have been abandoned and answered by an agent out of total Call Volume.                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
 Moreover, I have used one more donut chart to display how many calls have been unresolved and resolved by an agent out of total Call Volume.

 A column chart is a visual representation of categorical data that uses vertical columns to show comparisons and trends.                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
 I have used Column Chart to shows the number of customers by different impressions. The X-axis shows the different impression categories, which include Neutral, Satisfied, Not Served, Very Satisfied, Very Dissatisfied, and Dissatisfied. The Y-axis shows the number of customers.

                                 Column Chart   
                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
 ## Agent Analytics page :     
                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
This is the second page of the report where I have conducted an analysis on agents.                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
 ### Scatter Plot:                                                                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
 Scatter Plot or Scatter chart is used when we want to show the distribution of numerical values.                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
 I have used Scatter Plot to analyze the total no of calls and the duration of calls handle by each agent.

                                  Scatter Plot                                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
 ### Bar Chart :                                                                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
 Bar chart is similar to column charts, bar charts are suitable for comparing values across categories. Use them when you have long category names or when a horizontal layout suits your visualization needs.      
                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
 I have used Bar Chart to show the Total Calls received by an agent across various topics.

                                   Bar Chart                                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
 ### Line Chart:                                                                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
 Line charts is used to display trends over time. I have used line chart to show Customer Satisfaction% of each agent.                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/da86178c-df0e-47fb-a8f1-744196fe118a)
                                  Customer Satisfaction %                                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
 Moreover, I have used another line chart to display the Average speed of Answer of each agent. So that we can get an idea that which agent took less time to answer the call and vice versa.

                                  Avg Speed of Answer                                                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
 Along with that I have used one more line chart to show the Average Call handle time of each agent in the call Centre.

Here I have provided all the necessary slicer to filter the data according to the needs.

 After aggregating all the visuals, I have compiled our Power BI report. Below is a snapshot of all three pages of the Power BI report.
